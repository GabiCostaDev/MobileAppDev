# Midterm Update 

    New star button to prioritize by class 

    --> App.js now manages order states of each class by putting them in an array

    --> const handleStarClick (App.js) event listener moves the starred class to the top

    --> const handleStarClick (TodoList.js) communicate with the parent component to reorder

    --> two star states, 'starred' and 'unstarred' placed next to delete icon 
    
    --> once clicked, filled star ('starred'), white border around class, and a class shift to the top
