# Map My Path (Dec 2024)

## Description
    This App is inspired by the Map My Run App(s). Instead, Map My Path can be done with a stroll! No strict fitness boundaries! Using C.R.U.D. native app code, Node.js, Expo Go, and Mapbox API, this app allows its user to set a start and end location, trace their path thru map tracking, and log those traces along with stats!
